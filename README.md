Hi there! I'm Bardoth, a passionate frontend developer specializing in crafting engaging and user-friendly websites. With a keen eye for design and a love for clean code, I thrive on bringing creative ideas to life in the digital world

### About Me

My journey began with coding Discord bots using JavaScript, where I honed my skills in problem-solving and creative thinking. Since then, I've transitioned into web development. It's more a hobby then a job - but who knows what I might do in the future with my skills!
